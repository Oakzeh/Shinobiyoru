# 忍び寄る ~ Shinobiyoru ~ 忍び寄る

Shinobiyoru is a windows keylogger which is written in python. Shinobiyoru can log user key strokes, log tab switches, screenshot the user activity and email logged data in .txt format aswell as captured screenshots in .png format.

This program also can delete files after they have created them and change file viewing preferences to allow for a more inconspicuous logging approach.

Logging verbosity is currently only an option in the raw code, there is no command line feature able to set certain key values at the moment. In the future I will create a command line program that can create custom keyloggers i will refine it to meet the needs of many different emails and smtp servers as well as set custom settings.

Meant to be converted to a .exe executable file and placed in windows start up or with a few .lnk files pointing to the file.

Powershell needs to also run creating an exclusion path for the program. 

! currently only configured to send via ms outlook.
