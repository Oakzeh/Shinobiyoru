# 忍び寄る ~ Shinobiyoru ~ 忍び寄る

Shinobiyoru is a windows keylogger which is written in python. Shinobiyoru can log user key strokes, log tab switches, screenshot the user activity and email logged data in .txt format aswell as captured screenshots in .png format.

This program also can delete files after they have created them and change file viewing preferences to allow for a more inconspicuous logging approach.

Meant to be converted to a .exe executable file and placed in windows start up or with a few .lnk files pointing to the file.

Powershell needs to also run creating an exclusion path for the program. 

I will create a command line file that can create custom keyloggers in the future and i will refine it to meet the needs of many different emails and smtp servers.

currently only configured to send via ms outlook.
